# StocksFlipr
Stocks web app with backend and frontend to get stocks charts and company info
Frontend : - https://demo.jellysandy.ml

Login Guide :- email :- sandeep@gmail.com
               password :- sandeep1234
           
   Now after clicking on login wait until form fields reset.
   After form field reset. In the same tab go {demo.jellysandy.ml/dashboard}
 
  This is Beacuse api is hosting on {render} which is too slow  that why login form is not redirecting
  Also Login and Register Both works. They dont redirect because of slow api response(due to render platform free plan limitation)
